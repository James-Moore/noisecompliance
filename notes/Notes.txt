REDIS INFORMATION START
FROM:  https://github.com/antirez/redis/issues/3842
@yliu120 - By default, all docker containers running on the same host can connect to each other via the EXPOSED port - the other containers should access redis via redis:6379 (and not via the PUBLISHed port).
I suggest you take a look at the Docker Networking page here:
